# About us:

The Service Circle APP was essentially brought into the world by Janis Schiller. While traveling around the world in his camper, he had the idea that it would be great if there was a platform where you could exchange services instead of paying for them. In other words, the principle of service for service. This solves the problem of people being able to take advantage of a service that they could not afford in the classic "service for money" model.

He worked on the APP together with Alexander Kolotow and Amjed Khattab.
